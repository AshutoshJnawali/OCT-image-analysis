# OCT-image-analysis

This simple function takes in the optical coherence tomography image and allows to mark the boundaries of the optic nerve head (ONH).
The function then calls the additional function fit_ellipse to plot an ellipse on the marked ONH boundaries, and calculates parameters such as area, diameter, etc. 
The additional function and a sample OCT image is included in this repository. 
Let me know if you have any comments.
